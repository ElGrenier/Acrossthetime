Here is the Deposit of Across the time Map made by Adventquest in 1.8.

Here is an explaination on how the code is structured : 
The "effective code" contain the code translated and added to the game
The "Non effective code" contain two folders :
    - "copied code", it contain ALL the code of a specific context (like a boss, a dungeon/dimension, a PNJ, a quest, etc)
    - "translated code", it contains the code updated of the "copied code", but not totally finished, (like missing the correct coordonate if it has been changed, the time code of a cinematic)
